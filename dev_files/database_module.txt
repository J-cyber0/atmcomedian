To create a detailed text file addressing the second step, we'll focus on the development tasks for the Database Module (modules/database.py). This  
module is essential for managing transactional data and cryptocurrency transaction records using PostgreSQL and MongoDB. Below is a structured       
outline for the development tasks:

 ## Overview                                                                                                                                         
 The Database Module is crucial for storing and managing transactional data and cryptocurrency transaction records. This module will utilize         
 PostgreSQL for structured transactional data and MongoDB for flexible, document-based transaction details.
