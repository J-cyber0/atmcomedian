                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                     
    Development Workflow:                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Version Control: Utilize Git for version control to manage the codebase effectively. Ensure to regularly commit changes with descriptive       
    messages that clearly explain the modifications and their purpose. This practice aids in tracking progress and facilitates collaboration.        
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Code Reviews: In a team setting, conduct thorough code reviews to maintain high code quality and identify potential issues early in the        
    development process. This collaborative approach encourages knowledge sharing and improves code reliability.                                     
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Documentation: Document all functions and modules comprehensively. Each documentation entry should clearly state the purpose of the            
    function/module, describe its parameters, and specify the expected return values. This practice is crucial for maintaining code readability and  
    easing future maintenance.                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                     
    Next Steps:                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Begin with the Database Module: Start the implementation process with the database module (modules/database.py), as it forms the foundation fo 
    data storage and retrieval, which is essential for other modules' functionality.                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Parallel Development of CLI: Simultaneously, work on developing the command-line interface (cli.py). This early development of the CLI allows  
    for interaction with the application from the onset, facilitating testing and refinement of core functionalities.                                
                                                                                                                                                     
    - Follow a Structured Approach: Adhere to the outlined development workflow, focusing on building a robust foundation for the atmcomedian app.   
    Gradually add complexity and features, ensuring a solid and reliable application.                                                                
                                                                                                                                                     
    This structured approach to development ensures the creation of a well-architected and functional atmcomedian app, with a focus on reliability,  
    security, and user experience.
