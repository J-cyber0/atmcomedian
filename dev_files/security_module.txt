To create a detailed text file addressing the third step (Security Module) from the provided outline, you would follow these steps in a Linux/Ubuntu 
environment using the bash shell:                                                                                                                    

 1 Open Terminal: Access your terminal on Ubuntu.                                                                                                    
 2 Navigate to the Project Directory: Use the cd command to navigate to your project directory. If your project is located in ~/projects/atmcomedian,
   you would enter:                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                     
    cd ~/projects/atmcomedian                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                     
 3 Create the Security Module File: You'll create a text file named security_module_details.txt within the modules directory. If the directory       
   doesn't exist, create it first:                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                     
    mkdir -p modules                                                                                                                                 
    cd modules                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                     
 4 Write to the File: Use a text editor or a command-line utility like nano or echo to write the details. For simplicity, we'll use echo with        
   redirection to create or overwrite the file. Here's an example content based on the outline provided:                                             
                                                                                                                                                     
    echo "Security Module (modules/security.py)                                                                                                      
    Security is paramount in handling cryptocurrency transactions.                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                     
    • Authentication: Implement user authentication mechanisms to secure access to the application. This involves creating secure login and session  
    management systems to ensure that only authorized users can access certain functionalities.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                     
    • Encryption: Ensure sensitive data, especially private keys and transaction details, are encrypted both at rest and in transit. This could      
    involve using libraries such as PyCryptodome to encrypt and decrypt data using advanced encryption standards (AES) and ensuring that data sent   
    over the network is protected using TLS/SSL.                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                     
    • Compliance: Follow best practices and industry standards for security, such as using secure connections (HTTPS) and adhering to cryptographic  
    standards. This includes keeping up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates, and ensuring that the application complies with releva 
    laws and regulations regarding data protection and privacy.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                     
    The security module will be crucial in safeguarding user data and transactions, preventing unauthorized access, and ensuring the integrity and   
    confidentiality of sensitive information." > security_module_details.txt                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                     
 5 Verify the File Contents: Use cat to display the contents of the file and verify that it has been written correctly:                              
                                                                                                                                                     
    cat security_module_details.txt                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                     

This process creates a detailed text file named security_module_details.txt within the modules directory of your project, containing an outline and  
description of the tasks and considerations for developing the Security Module of the atmcomedian app.
